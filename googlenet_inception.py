# Is it possible to use BERT or ROBERTA for time-series classification
# XOR problem (there is a add problem)?

# research question
# How do you mask input? XLNET
# LogSparse test for simple task (filling gaps task)
# L*2 L(LogL2), using much fewer attention links
# the most elegant â€” within approximation
